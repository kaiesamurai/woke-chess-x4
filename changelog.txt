###  Version 0.1.1  ###
	* Minor improvements / 13.12.2023
	
	* Added tests and fixed several bugs in move generation and FEN reading.
	* Slight move doing/undoing optimizations (~4-7% faster)
	* Reduced Intel-dependence (now should compile for other CPUs).
	* Added GCC support and a Makefile.
	* Improved console interface of the engine.


###  Version 0.1  ###
	* The first version of the engine / 12.12.2023
	
	* Implemented the Board class using Bit Boards and a number of tricks
	  related to the board/pieces, some of which were taken from the Stockfish
	  and some from my old ChessMaster project that I have never published.
	* Magic bitboards for move generation (the one from Stockfish).
	  
	* Correct move generation and making/unmaking moves.
	* Loading from FEN and getting a FEN from the current position.
	* Can detect when the game is over with mate, stalemate, the fifty rule,
	  the triple repetition rule and with low material rule.
	* Zobrist tables.
	* Performance test function.
	
	* Static evaluation:
	* Simple evaluation based on material and Piece-Square Tables (written based
	  on intuition).
	* Separate scores for opening/middlegame and for endgame.
	
	* Search:
	* Simple search based on NegaMax and AlphaBeta.
	
	* Implemented 3 modes of work: own console interface, UCI, and Xboard/Winboard (version >= 2).
	* Tested in Winboard 4.8 and in Arena (in UCI mode).
	* Power tested in a tournament (0:10 + 1) of 150 games in total with several engines of comparable level.
	* Those engines (Cassandre and Belofte) were taken from CCRL.
	* Power: 900 elo - evaluated with Bayeselo.
