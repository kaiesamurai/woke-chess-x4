/*
*	main.cpp contains the main function.
* 
*	It does some general initialization, requests the work mode
*	and starts the engine.
* 
*	Bizzare ideas (just some notes):
*		1) Dynamic square's "importance" (center, king zone, piece concentration, etc)
*		   and mobility based on the importance of attacked squares
*		2) Factors beside material in game stage evaluation (for score interpolation)
*		   e.g. pawns advance
* 
*	Canceled ideas (were not useful in the version they were expected to be added in):
*		Countermove Table, SEE in move ordering, Mate Killers, Duo Pawns,
*		Candidate Pawns, Threat Move detection with Null Move, Multicut, Probcut, No pawns, Rook pair
*		
* 
*	TODO by future versions (general plans, features to try):
*		0.7) Pieces update (mobility, space, connectivity, center control, trapped pieces...)
*		0.7.1) Knights and bishops (outposts, bad bishop, fianchetto, color weakness)
*		0.7.2) Rooks and queens (rook on (semi)open file, rook on seventh rank,
*								 paired rooks, queens penalty for early development, tropism?)
*		0.8) Extensions (single move extension, check extension, capture/recapture extension,
*						 passed pawn extension, PV extension, singular extension...)
*		0.9) King update (mate at a glance, pins/x-rays, castlings (rights), pawn shield, pawn storm, tropism,
*						   virtual mobility, scaling with material, king zone attack, square control in king zone,
*						   king pawn tropism)
*		0.10) General endgame evaluation and search improvement, parallel search
*		1.0) Final improvements before the first release: some small additions, optimization, bugs fixing...)
*		1.1) Evaluation weights search via learning
*		1.2) ???
* 
*	Tips for another minor releases - things to be done before pushing to the git:
*		1) Running all the tests
*		2) Elo search with no less than 300 games (the higher the version - the more games are required)
*		3) Test run in all the three modes - Xboard, UCI, console
*		4) Ensuring correct Makefile
*		5) Ensuring all the changes were properly documented in changelog.txt and the readme.md was properly modified
* 
*	Current version TODO: -
* 
*	Bugs: -
